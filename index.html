		<h1>About Samarth</h1>
		<p>Hey! My name is Samarth Agarwal and I am a software engineering student at University Of Ottawa. </p>
		<p>I am interested in system architecture, distributed systems and data science. Additionally, I am also interested in product management and business development and enjoy contemplating and discussing business strategy and current and upcoming technology trends and their effects. As this combination of interests makes obvious, I also have an interest in technology entrepreneurship. The trends I am most interested in are IoT-derived contextual awareness, O2O, and digital identity management. My other interests include economics, finance, and mathematics.</p>
